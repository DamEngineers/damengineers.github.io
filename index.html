<p><img src="photo_bridge.jpg" height="810" width="612" align="left">Congratulations, You've somehow stumbled upon this website!!! (What are you doing poking around for Mr&MrsPappy?) Well, welcome to my placeholder for our wedding website, I know as well as you do everyone is trying to snag mrandmrspappy.com (beat you to it bitches). If you're reading this then we haven't talked seriously about getting hitched yet or I would probably have updated it. But you've discovered that I'm balls deep and want to remain that way for the long haul, I want to be Mister Pappy for real (someday). I feel like you're still searching for whatever it is you've been searching for and I didn't want to freak you out with my big realization (but now you know). I think that's also why we're so hesitant to tell each other how much we love each other (Maybe that's changed by now)(writting for future you is proving difficult). The good news is we own this site through 2028 so no rush (we also have pappywedding.com, but there is nothing there and I like this one more). Do what you will with that information, but I hope it's a long embrace next time we see each other and maybe a few tears (happy ones of course). I know it's probably scary, but it's a good scary I promise!
<br> <br>
Love ya Pappy!

Update 3/18/2018 Late at night and through a wall of tears:

Whelp, shit. Seems like you needed to look for that something a little harder than I thought. I really hope you find it before you move on to someone else or this would've been quite a silly purchase (and I'll have a broken heart of course). I haven't decided if I am going to share this with you or not yet, it's kind of embarassing and sad now. Maybe you will stumble upon it like I thought maybe you would above. But really who goes around googling mushy Pappy shit.
<br><br>
...Just checked even if you google "mr and mrs pappy" you only get an expensive set of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mr-Mrs-Pappy-Marble-Coasters/dp/B07B2H4XDF">coasters</a>. You have to actually enter MrAndMrsPappy.com.
<br><br>
Anyways, I still love you. And tough shit if you don't like it.
