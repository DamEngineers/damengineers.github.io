<h1>Hey Pap Daddy!</h1>

<p><img src="photo_bridge.jpg" height="810" width="612" align="left">Congratulations, You've somehow stumbled upon this website! If you're reading this we haven't seriously talked about getting hitched yet or I would have updated it, but you've discovered that I'm balls deep and want to remain that way for the long haul, I want to be Mister Pappy for real (someday). I feel like your still searching for whatever it is you've been searching for and I didn't want to freak you out with my big realization. The good news is we own the site through 2028 so no rush. Do what you will with that information, but I hope it's a long embrace next time we see eachother and maybe a few tears (happy ones of course).
<br> <br>
Love ya Pappy!

Update 3/18/2018: Whelp, shit. Seems like you needed to look for that something a little harder than I thought. I really hope you find it before you move on to someone else or this would've been quite a silly purchase (and I'll have a broken heart of course). </p>
