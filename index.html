<p><img src="photo_bridge.jpg" height="810" width="612" align="left">Congratulations, You've somehow stumbled upon this website!!! (What are you doing poking around for Mr&MrsPappy?) Well, welcome to my placeholder for our wedding website, I know as well as you do everyone is trying to snag mrandmrspappy.com (beat you to it bitches). If you're reading this then we haven't talked seriously about getting hitched yet or I would probably have updated it. But you've discovered that I'm balls deep and want to remain that way for the long haul, I want to be Mister Pappy for real (someday). I feel like you're not quite ready, lije you're still searching for whatever it is you've been searching for and I didn't want to freak you out with my big realization (but now you know). I think that's also why we're so hesitant to tell each other how much we love each other (Maybe that's changed by now)(writting for future you is proving difficult). The good news is we own this site through 2028 so no rush (we also have pappywedding.com, but there is nothing there and I like this one more). Do what you will with this information, but I hope it's a long embrace next time we see each other and maybe a few tears (happy ones of course). I know it's probably scary, but it's a good scary I promise!
<br> <br>
Love ya Pappy!

Update 3/18/2018 The Break Up
<br>
It's one in the morning and I'm writing be through a wall of tears.
<br>
Whelp, shit. Seems like you needed to look for that something a little harder than I thought. This seems pretty sad and embarrassing now. I really hope you find it before you move on to someone else or this would've been quite a silly purchase (and I'll have a broken heart of course).
<br><br>

Anyways, I still love you. And tough shit if you don't like it.
<br><br><br>
  
Update 4/16/2018: Definitely Fucked Up:
<br>
  
So it only took a month to realize that indeed this was a silly purchase. How would I even trust you again? The way that you handled the break up was literally the worst. "Im all in". "I want an open relationship". "Actually that sounds like more work than the current situation, I just want out". "Im just so busy so I don't want to invest anything into this but if you want to hang around for a while I'll probably come back". A lot of flopping around in 3 days.
<br>
I was as caring, supporting, and loving as possible. But you've decided that whatever it is that you're doing you don't want to do it together. I'm not sure how I could get back on a team like that, how could i ever give everything again to a team like that.
