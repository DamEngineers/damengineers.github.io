<h1>Hey Pap Daddy!</h1>

<p><img src="photo_bridge.jpg" height="810" width="612" align="left">Congratulations, You've somehow stumbled upon this website!!! (What are you doing poking around for Mr&MrsPappy?) Well, welcome to my placeholder for our wedding website, I know as well as you do everyone is trying to snag mrandmrspappy.com (beat you to it bitches). If you're reading this then we haven't talked seriously about getting hitched yet or I would probably have updated it. But you've discovered that I'm balls deep and want to remain that way for the long haul, I want to be Mister Pappy for real (someday). I feel like you're not quite  ready yet. You're still searching for whatever it is you've been searching for the last few years and I didn't want to freak you out with my big realization (but now you know). I think that's also why we're so hesitant to tell each other how much we love each other (Maybe that's changed by now)(writting for future you is proving difficult). The good news is we own this site through 2028 so no rush (we also have pappywedding.com, but there is nothing there and I like this one more). Do what you will with this information, but I hope it's a long embrace next time we see each other and maybe a few tears (happy ones of course). I know it's probably scary, but it's a good scary I promise!
<br> <br>
Love ya Pap!

Update 3/18/2018 The Break Up
<br>
It's one in the morning and I'm writing be through a wall of tears.
<br><br>
Whelp, shit. Seems like you needed to look for that something a little harder than I thought. This seems pretty sad and embarrassing now. I really hope you find it before you move on to someone else or this would've been quite a silly purchase (and I'll have a broken heart of course).
<br><br>

Anyways, I still love you. And tough shit if you don't like it.
<br><br><br>
  
Update 4/16/18: Definitely A Silly Purchase
<br><br>
I'm not even really sure why you broke up with me. Somehow you went from stating that you wanted to be all in on Friday to having much too much to look for to be in a relationship. What are you even looking for? Plus you're the one who hates I Spy! After some reflection, it seems that you've broken up with me because I'm not worth the slightest amount of your time or energy. And it hurts.
<br><br>
You looked at everything I had given you,  you looked at the dreams I had for a beautiful future, you looked at the open the heart I had to give. And you walked away. You knew you were risking everything with me, and you walked away. And it hurts.
<br><br>
It's difficult to imagine getting back on the same team with someone who placed so much on such a risky bet. It may be possible that I someday look back at your situation with more understanding and clarity, but could I ever trust you like I did before?
<br><br>
I definitely miss you and think about you, but I'm trying as hard as I can to stop hurting and move on.
